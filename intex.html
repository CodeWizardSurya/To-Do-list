            <h2>Eleanor & Park</h2>
            <h5>Rainbow Rowell</h5>
            <p>Eleanor & Park" is a heartfelt and poignant novel that follows the unlikely romance between two misfit
                teenagers, Eleanor and Park, set in 1986. Eleanor is a new student at Park's high school, and she stands
                out with her eccentric style and troubled home life. Park, on the other hand, is a quiet and
                introspective boy who loves comic books and music. Despite their differences, they form a connection
                through their shared love of music and comics, gradually falling for each other as they bond over
                mixtapes and shared moments on the bus ride to and from school. However, their budding romance faces
                numerous obstacles, including bullying, family dysfunction, and societal prejudices. As their
                relationship deepens, Eleanor and Park must confront the challenges of first love and the uncertainty of
                whether their feelings are reciprocated. "Eleanor & Park" is a beautifully written story about the
                complexities of teenage love, friendship, and self-discovery, capturing the bittersweet experience of
                longing for someone who may never love you back in the same way.</p>
